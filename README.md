# 📦 Supply Chain Analysis Dashboard – Power BI

## 🔍 Overview
This Power BI project provides a comprehensive **Supply Chain Analysis** to help stakeholders monitor, evaluate, and optimize key operations such as procurement, production, inventory, and logistics. The dashboard offers interactive visualizations and data-driven insights to enhance decision-making and improve efficiency across the supply chain.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Analyze supply chain performance metrics in real time.  
- Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in logistics and procurement.  
- Track supplier performance and delivery timelines.  
- Optimize inventory management and demand forecasting.  
- Provide actionable insights for reducing operational costs.

---

## 📊 Key Features & Visuals
- **KPI Cards:** Overall revenue, cost, profit margin, lead time, and on-time delivery rate.  
- **Procurement Analysis:** Supplier-wise purchase cost, quantity trends, and delivery delays.  
- **Inventory Management:** Stock levels, reorder points, and warehouse utilization.  
- **Transportation Insights:** Freight cost trends and delivery performance by region.  
- **Production Metrics:** Cycle time, throughput efficiency, and defect rate.  
- **Geographical View:** Map visualization showing supplier and customer locations.  
- **Trend Analysis:** Time-series visuals for demand forecasting and supply performance.

## 🗂️ Data Model
The Power BI model integrates data from multiple sources:
- **Procurement Data** – supplier details, purchase orders, delivery schedules  
- **Inventory Data** – warehouse stock, product categories, reorder levels  
- **Sales/Distribution Data** – order fulfillment, delivery time, logistics costs  
- **Financial Data** – revenue, cost, and profit margins  

Relationships are built on keys such as `ProductID`, `SupplierID`, `OrderID`, and `Date`.

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop (.pbix)** – for report creation and visualization  
- **Excel / SQL / CSV** – as data sources (depending on your setup)  
- **DAX & Power Query** – for data modeling and transformation  

---

## 📈 Insights & Impact
- Identified high-cost suppliers contributing to 60% of procurement expenses.  
- Reduced average delivery delay by 15% using lead-time trend analysis.  
- Improved warehouse stock turnover ratio by analyzing slow-moving items.  
- Enhanced demand forecast accuracy by integrating historical order data.

---

## 🧩 How to Use
1. Open the `.pbix` file in **Power BI Desktop**.  
2. Refresh the data connections to load the latest dataset.  
3. Explore dashboards through slicers (Date, Region, Product Category, Supplier).  
4. Export insights or visuals as PDF or PowerPoint for reporting purposes.
